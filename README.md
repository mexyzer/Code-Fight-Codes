# Code-Fight-Codes
Solved problems from the CodeFight website

While in between college classes, I found that Code Fights (https://codefights.com) had updated their website. They now have an Arcade Mode which presents you with problems to solve. This repository is a collection of the solutions I came up with. I also include my "Position" which shows that I am the (Position) person to solve this problem. I have only included C++ solutions and Position.
