# Code-Fight-Codes
Solved problems from the CodeFight website

During the down time of my classes, I found that Code Fights (https://codefights.com) had updated their website. They now have an Arcade Mode which presents you with problems to solve. This repository is a collection of the solutions I came up with. I also include my "solve number" which represents how many people have solved the problem before me. I only include C++ solutions.
